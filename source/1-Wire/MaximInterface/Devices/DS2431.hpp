/// @details The DS2431 is a 1024-bit, 1-WireÂ® EEPROM chip organized
/// as four memory pages of 256 bits each. Data is written to an 8-byte
/// scratchpad, verified, and then copied to the EEPROM memory. As a
/// special feature, the four memory pages can individually be write
/// protected or put in EPROM-emulation mode, where bits can only be
/// changed from a 1 to a 0 state. The DS2431 communicates over the
/// single-conductor 1-Wire bus. The communication follows the standard
/// 1-Wire protocol. Each device has its own unalterable and unique
/// 64-bit ROM registration number that is factory lasered into the chip.
/// The registration number is used to address the device in a multidrop,
/// 1-Wire net environment.
