/// DS28E17 1-Wire®-to-I2C Master Bridge
/// @details The DS28E17 is a 1-Wire slave to I2C master bridge
/// device that interfaces directly to I2C slaves at standard
/// (100kHz max) or fast (400kHz max). Data transfers serially by
/// means of the 1-Wire® protocol, which requires only a single data
/// lead and a ground return. Every DS28E17 is guaranteed to have a
/// unique 64-bit ROM registration number that serves as a node
/// address in the 1-Wire network. Multiple DS28E17 devices can
/// coexist with other devices in the 1-Wire network and be accessed
/// individually without affecting other devices. The DS28E17 allows
/// using complex I2C devices such as display controllers, ADCs, DACs,
/// I2C sensors, etc. in a 1-Wire environment. Each self-timed DS28E17
/// provides 1-Wire access for a single I2C interface.
